# QuadTreeVisualized
Quad Tree implementation with visual support on iOS

In order to see the basic quad tree with inserted points and how it splits,  download the project
change the storyboard entry point to QuadVC (Mess with the points to see different effects!)

In order to see the basic quad tree QUERY ontop of the other stuff,  download the project
change the storyboard entry point to QueryVisualVC (Mess with the queryRange to see different effects!)
